$Module rs_template 3 "An example vmod"

We describe our vmod, all lines starting with a $ are special as they
are used to generate boilerplate code, the others are regular documentation

The `rs_template` above matches the `vmod_rs_template` in `Cargo.toml`

for more information, check https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/vmod.html

$Function BOOL is_even(INT)

This will tell you if a number is even, isn't that odd?

$Function STRING captain_obvious([INT n])
